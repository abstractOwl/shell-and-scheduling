Project page: http://www.cs.ucsb.edu/~ravenben/classes/170/html/hw1.html

## Progress:
- [ ] SiSH -- Simple SHell
   - [x] Implement basic shell functionality
   - [ ] Implement IO Redirection (`<` and `>`)
   - [ ] Implement Piping
- [ ] Scheduler


## Notes
* `cd` will not work because it's implemented by shells, is not an actual program
